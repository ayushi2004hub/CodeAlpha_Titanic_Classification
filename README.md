# CodeAlpha_Titanic_Classification

## 🛳️ Project: Titanic Survival Prediction

This project is part of the CodeAlpha Data Science Internship. The goal is to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not based on features like gender, age, and passenger class.
